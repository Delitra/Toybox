Introduction
------------

VoiceRadio is a combination of a microphone and a radio that together can
be put into a roleplay server for a "radio station host" job. Those 
in the line of the sight of microphone will be heard by those near a
radio. Note that by default everyone can hear everyone's voice on a server,
so the gamemode must first have some limitation on who can hear who.

Both the microphone and radio can be toggled on and off. When the radio
is off, no sound will be "emitted" by it. When the microphone is off,
it will not pick up any voices.

VoiceRadio is not capable of broadcasting music. It only broadcasts
voice chat.

A microphone model from Guitar Hero is bundled. It will be automatically
downloaded to client's computers. Remember to put it on fast download
if that applies to your situation. The model was extracted

DarkRP
------

For you to use this in DarkRP, you must give a job the ability to buy
the microphone. Give everyone the ability to buy the radio. You may have
to modify DarkRP to delete microphones on job change.

Remember to turn on voice chat radius.

Tips
----

* If you are going to charge for the radio, the price should be low to
  encourage purchase.

* Radio station hosts may buy a ton of radios and distribute them
  throughout the streets, practically equating as micspam.

* Because there is no way to play music, users will play music into
  their microphone.

* To block a host individually, users can mute the player using the
  regular Garry's Mod main menu.

* Some people play very bad music or are very boring, but I suppose that
  I didn't need to tell you that.
